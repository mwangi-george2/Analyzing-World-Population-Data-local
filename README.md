# Analyzing-World-Population-Data
The World Population Data collection offers population figures for every nation from 1960 to 2020, along with some extra data by nation, including its region, income category, and special notes (if any). The primary purpose of this projectÂ is to investigate a number of questions. These questions include:

1. How did the population of Kenya change over time?

2. How did the population in different parts of the world change over time?

3. Which country or countries have experienced the highest increase/decrease in population over time?

4. Which country or countries have been experiencing the highest increase/decrease in population in the last five (or ten) years?

5. How many people were born in Kenya during my birth year?

6. How does income group affect a country's population growth?

7. What are the tendencies of the population growth region-wise?
